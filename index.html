                    <div class="col-md">
                        <p>My professional journey is punctuated by meaningful contributions and notable accomplishments. As a Design Engineering Intern at Parts Apart in Toronto, I embarked on a multifaceted role that traversed various stages of product development. I meticulously conducted market research, leading to the identification of a strategic niche, and orchestrated the end-to-end creation of a groundbreaking product. Leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, I not only refined prototypes but also fostered close collaboration with the company founder to transform abstract concepts into tangible, marketable products. This experience solidified my ability to bridge the gap between imaginative innovation and technical execution, showcasing my holistic approach to engineering problem-solving.</p>

                    <div class="col-md">
                        <p>I've also ventured beyond formal roles, enthusiastically participating in projects and extracurricular activities. Notably, in the Engineering Strategies and Practice II course at the University of Toronto, I played an integral role in designing a project for a prominent client. Through adept communication and meticulous documentation, I ensured the successful realization of a functional prototype. These experiences underscore my commitment to bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application, highlighting my dedication to engineering innovation. Moreover, my proficiency shines through projects like creating a miniature pneumatic engine, designing wooden furniture, and joining Formula SAE which reflect my hands-on skills and unwavering passion for applying engineering expertise in tangible ways.</p>

                                    <p>Created during a machining course at George Brown College. This felt like my very first mechanical project. I learned more about machining metals, as all of my prior experience was with wood. I learned how to use various machines like a lathe, and overall I think this project shows my commitment to learning even outside of the University of Toronto environment.</p>

                                <p>Currently, I am a student at the University of Toronto pursuing a Bachelor's of Applied Science and Engineering through the Mechanical Engineering program. My time within the program has allowed me to develop various skills that will aid me in engineering related careers. I have also obtained plenty of relevant experience working with others through volunteering and high school involvement. I would love to make new connections, and gain more experience in the field I am pursuing.</p>

                                <p>I am pursuing the Mechatronics and Manufacturing streams within Mechanical Engineering. My work with Solidworks and construction clearly gives me valuable insight into what these two paths may look like. My work in Engineering Strategies and Practice taught me a lot about documentation while my part-time work at Dairy Queen gave me a glimpse into industry and business, which is useful in my pursuit of a business minor. </p>

                                <p>Outside of my engineering related experience, I have a love for photography, and it is one of my favourite creative outlets.

I have shared three of my favourite pieces below.</p>
